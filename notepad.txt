Steps to Push to Both Repositories at Once

1. Ensure You Have Both Remotes Set Up
git remote -v

Example output:
   
   origin    https://github.com/KiptooMannu/Automated-PSVBS.git (fetch)
   origin    https://github.com/KiptooMannu/Automated-PSVBS.git (push)
   upstream  https://github.com/Ngetich-86/AUTOMATED-PSV-SEAT-RESERVATION-SYSTEM.git (fetch)
   upstream  https://github.com/Ngetich-86/AUTOMATED-PSV-SEAT-RESERVATION-SYSTEM.git (push)

2. Push to Your Repository (origin)
   
   First, push your changes to your own repository:

   bash
   git push origin main

3. Push to Your Friend’s Repository (upstream)

   After pushing to origin, you can push your changes to your friend’s repository (upstream):

   bash
   git push upstream main

1. Ensure You Have Both Remotes Set Up
git remote -v

Example output:
   
   origin    https://github.com/KiptooMannu/Automated-PSVBS.git (fetch)
   origin    https://github.com/KiptooMannu/Automated-PSVBS.git (push)
   upstream  https://github.com/Ngetich-86/AUTOMATED-PSV-SEAT-RESERVATION-SYSTEM.git (fetch)
   upstream  https://github.com/Ngetich-86/AUTOMATED-PSV-SEAT-RESERVATION-SYSTEM.git (push)


2. Fetch Changes from Your Friend’s Repository (upstream)

   Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository to get any updates your friend has made. This will download the latest code from upstream/main:

   bash
   git fetch upstream

3. Merge the Changes from upstream/main into Your Local main

   After fetching the changes, you need to merge those changes into your local branch. This step ensures that you are working with the most up-to-date code:

   bash
   git merge upstream/main
   

4. Push Your Merged Changes to Your Repository (origin)

   After merging your friend's changes into your local repository, the next step is to push both your changes and the merged changes to your personal repository (origin):

   bash
   git push origin main



5. Push to Your Friend’s Repository (upstream)

   Now that your local branch is up-to-date with both your changes and your friend’s changes, you can push the updates to your friend’s repository (upstream). This will make your contributions available to your friend:

   bash
   git push upstream main
